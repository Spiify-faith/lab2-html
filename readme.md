In this lab, we have been tasked with creating a well-structured HTML5 webpage, it includes implementing a semantic layout, navigation menu, main content area, sidebar and footer. The project also requires adding a contact form with HTML5 validation to ensure user inputs are properly formatted before submission.
Additionally, we are to validate our HTML code using the W3C Validator. After fixing any issues that arise from validation, we are to publish the project on GitHub by initializing a Git repository, committing the project files, and pushing the repository to GitHub.
As part of the collaboration task, we are required to fork a partnerâ€™s repository, add a section crediting them, and submit a Pull Request.
